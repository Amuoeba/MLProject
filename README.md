## Machine Learning 2017/18  Project:
## Implementation of deep convulutional Q learning to play simple games

My goal this semester is to to implement and experiment with Deep Convolutional Q learning.
I will use Open AI Gym and its readily prepared game environments and its interfaces to develop and test my 
reinforcement learning networks. I will start by implementing simple Q learning on simple games, to get the feel
for the problem, and will slowly move to more complex games with implementations of Deep Convolutional Q learning algorithms.
As a finished project I expect to train a network to play SpaceInvaders, Pacman, Doom or Mario. I still have to decide on wich game I will focus.

I will allso try to find recent breakthroughs/improvements of basic reinforcement learning algorithms and try to implement the proposed solutions in my projects, or at least present the ideas at presentation time.
